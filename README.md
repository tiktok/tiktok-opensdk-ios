# TikTok OpenSDK for iOS

## Introduction

TikTok OpenSDK is a framework that enables your users to log into your app with their TikTok accounts and share images and videos to TikTok. This SDK is available for download through Swift Package Manager and Cocoapods.

## Getting Started

Minimum iOS version is 12.0 and minimum XCode version is 10.0. See [iOS Quickstart](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/mobile-sdk-ios-quickstart/) for more details.

### Developer Portal Application

Sign up for a developer account in our [Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/login/). Upon application approval, the Developer Portal will provide you with a `Client Key` and `Client Secret`. See how to register your app [here](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app/). Before proceeding, make sure to add the Login Kit and/or Share Kit to your app by navigating to the `Manage apps` page, and clicking `+ Add products` in your developer portal account.

### Install the SDK

#### Swift Package Manager

Add the library to your XCode project as a Swift Package:

1. Click `File -> Add Packages...`
2. Paste the repository URL: `https://github.com/tiktok/tiktok-opensdk-ios`
3. Select `Dependency Rule` -> `Up to Next Major Version` and input the major version you want (i.e. `2.3.0`)
4. Select `Add to Project` -> Your project
5. Click `Copy Dependency` and select the libraries you need (`TikTokOpenAuthSDK`, `TikTokOpenSDKCore`, `TikTokOpenShareSDK`)

#### Cocoapods

1. Add the following to your Podfile
```ruby
pod 'TikTokOpenSDKCore'
pod 'TikTokOpenAuthSDK'
pod 'TikTokOpenShareSDK'
```
2. Run `pod install --repo-update`

### Configure Your XCode Project

1. Open your Info.plist file and add/update the following keys.
    - Add the following values to `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes`:
        - `tiktokopensdk` for Login Kit
        - `tiktoksharesdk` for Share Kit
        - `snssdk1233` and `snssdk1180` to check if TikTok is installed on your device.
    - Add the key `TikTokClientKey` with your apps `Client Key` as the value.
    - Add your apps `Client Key` to `CFBundleURLSchemes`.
```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
    <string>tiktokopensdk</string>
    <string>tiktoksharesdk</string>
    <string>snssdk1180</string>
    <string>snssdk1233</string>
</array>
<key>TikTokClientKey</key>
<string>$TikTokClientKey</string>
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>$TikTokClientKey</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```
2. Add the following code to your app's AppDelegate:
```swift
import TikTokOpenSDKCore

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ app: UIApplication,open url: URL, 
                     options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
        if TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(url) {
            return true
        }
        return false
    }
        
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, 
                     continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, 
                     restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
        if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb {
            if TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(userActivity.webpageURL) {
                return true
            }
        }
        return false
    }
    
}
```
3. Add the following code to your app's SceneDelegate file if it has one:
```swift
import TikTokOpenSDKCore

class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, 
               openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
        if TikTokURLHandler.handleOpenURL(URLContexts.first?.url) {
            return
        }
    }

}
```

## Login Kit Usage

Login Kit functionality depends on the `TikTokOpenSDKCore` and `TikTokOpenAuthSDK` libraries, so be sure to select these when adding the package or cocoapods. The following code snippet shows how to create an authorization request and handle the response. See [Login Kit for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-ios-quickstart/) for more details.
```swift
import TikTokOpenAuthSDK

let authRequest = TikTokAuthRequest(scopes: ["user.info.basic"], redirectURI: "https://www.example.com/path")
authRequest.send { response in
    let authResponse = response as? TikTokAuthResponse else { return }
    if authResponse.errorCode == .noError {
        print("Auth code: \(authResponse.code)")
    } else {
       print("Authorization Failed! 
             Error: \(authResponse.error ?? "") 
             Error Description: \(authResponse.errorDescription ?? ""))
    }
}
```
Your app is responsible for maintaining a strong reference to the request in order to receive the response callback. You can discard it when you are done with the response.

## Share Kit Usage

Share Kit functionality depends on the `TikTokOpenSDKCore` and `TikTokOpenShareSDK` libraries, so be sure to select these when adding the package or cocoapods. The following code snippet shows how to create a share request and handle the response. See [Share Kit for iOS](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/share-kit-ios-quickstart-v2/) for more details.
```swift
import TikTokOpenShareSDK

let shareRequest = TikTokShareRequest(localIdentifiers: [...], mediaType: .video, redirectURI: "https://www.example.com/path")
shareRequest.send { response in
    if let shareResponse = response as? TikTokShareResponse {
        if shareResponse.errorCode == .noError {
            print("Share succeeded!")
        } else {
            print("Share Failed!")
            print("Error Code: \(shareResponse.errorCode.rawValue)")
            print("Error Message: \(shareResponse.errorDescription ?? "")")
            print("Share State: \(shareResponse.shareState)")
        }
    } else {
        // Handle error when response is not a TikTokShareResponse
    }

}
```
Your app is responsible for maintaining a strong reference to the request in order to receive the response callback. You can discard it when you are done with the response.

## Demos

Minimum iOS version for the demo apps is iOS 14.0 for ShareDemo and iOS 12.0 for LoginDemo.

1. Open `LoginDemo/TikTokLoginDemo.xcodeproj` or `ShareDemo/TikTokShareDemo.xcodeproj`.
2. In order to run the demos on a physical iOS device, you will need a working universal link, and a provisioning profile with the Associated Domains capability. Import your provisioning profile, update the bundle ID, and add your universal link domain to the Associated Domains section. If you are running the LoginDemo, make sure you have added your universal link to the Redirect URI portion of the Login Kit section in the developer portal.
3. Open the `Info.plist` file as source code and replace the uses of `${TikTokClientKey}` with your own client key from the developer portal. 
4. Run the project to view the kit in action.
